      "Abstract": "SmaCC (Smalltalk Compiler-Compiler) is a freely available parser generator for Smalltalk. It generates LR parsers and is a replacement for the T-Gen parser generator. SmaCC overcomes many of T-Gen’s limitations that make it difficult to produce parsers. SmaCC can generate parsers for ambiguous grammars and grammars with overlapping tokens."

      "Abstract": "The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC), sponsored by Microsoft Research, offers a unique forum for ACM student members at the undergraduate and graduate levels to present their original research at <Programming> before a panel of judges and conference attendees, and creates opportunities for learning and networking among researchers and practitioners. The SRC gives visibility to not only up-and-coming young researchers, but also to the field of computer science research and its community. \n",
