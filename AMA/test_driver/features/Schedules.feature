Feature: Schedules
  As a conference participant
  I want to be able to have my own schedule and personalize it
  So I can keep track of my activities and organize myself better.

  Scenario: Add sessions to a schedule
    Given I expect the "numberOfActivitiesDay1" to be "0 activities"
    # When I add a session with title "Random Title" to the day "1" schedule
    # Then the day "1" schedule should contain that "Random Title" session
    # And I expect the "numberOfActivitiesDay1" to be "1 activity"


  # Scenario: Remove a session from a schedule
   # Given I have a schedule with a certain session in it
   # When I remove that session from the schedule
   # Then the schedule should not contain the session anymore
